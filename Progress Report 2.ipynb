    "## Project Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use MTA bus data, Monte Carlo passenger simulation and weather data to create a model that will determine how long a passenger should wait for the next bus, before giving up and chosing an alternative mode of transportation. Our focus thus far has been on one particular bus stop (the southbound M100 on 135th street) in August of 2017. However, this model could be iterated system-wide for every bus stop location. \n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below serves as a reference for our analysis and is explained in more detail in the passages that follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "![diagram](analysis_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Monte Carlo simulation, we will first assume that there is a uniform probability that a passenger will approach a stop at any given time of day. The reason for this choice is for it's realism (it is a common assumtion among staff analysts at the MTA's operations and planning department) and for it's ease of computation. Later on, we can experiment different ridership behaviors such as a bimodal probability distribution (peak in the early morning and evening for commuters). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Passenger Wait Times (Sam)\n",
    "\n",
    "We view each day's bus arrivals, at a given bus stop, as points on a timeline. Similarly, each  passenger arival at the bus stop falls also on the day's timeline. Calculating wait times then amounts to finding the difference between the passenger's arrival and the arrival of the very next bus along this timeline. Our goal here is to create a dataset with the time (as in time of day) of approach as the independent variable and the wait time as the dependent variable. This data will serve as the validation set for our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bus Time Deltas/headways (David)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each simulated passenger, we would like to find how crowded a given bus is. To find this, we will simulate many passengers \"boarding\" busses by assigning a population of $n$ daily passengers a uniform random timestamp between the last and first busses of the day. Buses which feature an abnormally long timedelta (long time interval between current and last bus arrival) will generally be more crowded. Again, the time of day is our independent variable and the number of people on the bus (crowding) is the dependent variable.  This data will serve as the validation set for our model.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Model (Angelica & Excel)\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature variables will be include weather data columns and time of day, while the target variables will be the crowding and wait times as experienced by the passengers (to predict what we simulated in the Monte Carlo method step.) Our goal is \n",
    "\n",
    "1. to produce predicts the values of the two biased ecdf **charts** (each of which has a time as input and a probability as output, so it won't display the other inputs to the machine learning model, but hopefully considering more variables should help make the predictions more accurate).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. to produce a general weather-conscious **model** that predicts passenger experience (inspected wait time and inspected crowdedness)\n",

    "Considerations for this step include, but are not limited to:\n",

So far as we can see, there can be two causes for this error: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Some of the bus arrival data is being unnecessarily deleted or is missing; there are no \"one-bus-only\" days at this stop.\n",
    "2. The number of passengers should be adapted to the number of busses for each transit day. This would mean the error was setting the daily ridership at a constant of `numPassengers=1000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, once find the source of this error, we will have our \"base truth\" to help train our models on in the next phase of our project. "

    "## Project Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use MTA bus data, Monte Carlo passenger simulation and weather data to create a model that will determine how long a passenger should wait for the next bus, before giving up and chosing an alternative mode of transportation. Our focus thus far has been on one particular bus stop (the southbound M100 on 135th street) in August of 2017. However, this model could be iterated system-wide for every bus stop location. \n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below serves as a reference for our analysis and is explained in more detail in the passages that follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "![diagram](analysis_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Monte Carlo simulation, we will first assume that there is a uniform probability that a passenger will approach a stop at any given time of day. The reason for this choice is for it's realism (it is a common assumtion among staff analysts at the MTA's operations and planning department) and for it's ease of computation. Later on, we can experiment different ridership behaviors such as a bimodal probability distribution (peak in the early morning and evening for commuters). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Passenger Wait Times ([Sam](#Sam-Mundle))\n",
    "\n",
    "We view each day's bus arrivals, at a given bus stop, as points on a timeline. Similarly, each  passenger arival at the bus stop falls also on the day's timeline. Calculating wait times then amounts to finding the difference between the passenger's arrival and the arrival of the very next bus along this timeline. Our goal here is to create a dataset with the time (as in time of day) of a passenger's approach to the bus station as the independent variable and the wait time as the dependent variable. This data will serve as the validation set for our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bus Time Deltas/headways ([David](#David-Hadaller))\n",
    "\n",
    "For the simulated passengers, each approaching the bus stop at some random time, we would like to find how crowded the bus they board will be. To find this, we will simulate many passengers \"boarding\" busses by assigning a population of $n$ daily passengers a uniform random timestamp between the last and first busses of the day. Buses which feature an abnormally long timedelta (long time interval between current and last bus arrival) will generally be more crowded, since more passengers accumulate at the bus stop as time goes on. Again, the time of day is our independent variable and the number of people on the bus (crowding) is the dependent variable.  This data will serve as the validation set for our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weather Data ([Angelika](#Angelika-Shastapalava))\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather data will include columns for precipitation, wind speed, and visibility for the month of August 2017 in NYC. These will serve as our features for predicting crowding and wait time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Model ([Excel](#Excel-Espina))\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature variables will be include weather data columns and time of day, while the target variables will be the crowding and wait times as experienced by the passengers (to predict what we simulated in the Monte Carlo method step.) Our goal is to produce a general weather-conscious model that predicts passenger experience (wait time and crowdedness)\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations for this step include, but are not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- model evaluation (accuracrecall,prediction, lift and all that)\n",
    "- model type (linear, non linear/ regression/decision tree)\n",

This could signify that the uniform distribution hypothesis may have been too generous, since, during the hours between 3am and 5am, most people are asleep. And few busses run druring those times, so assuming people will wait for hours until the next bus comes might be an unnatural assumption to make. FOr this reason, we can restrict our analysis to the times between 5am and 1am the next day for our machine learning models."

    "\n",
    "Here are our top picks for regressors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gradient Boosting Machines ***(top pick)***:\n",
    "    - Why: GBMs are typically a composite model that combines the efforts of multiple weak models to create a strong model, and each additional weak model reduces the mean squared error (MSE) of the overall model. Our goal would be to minimize MSE to increase the accuracy of our predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random Forest:\n",
    "    - Why: does not suffer from the overfitting like with Decision Trees. Instead of randomly choosing to split from just **hourly weather** and **time of day**, we can have two trees that randomly split from each and find the best model. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decision Trees:  \n",
    "    - Reduction in Standard Deviation (metric): This is a regression metric that measures how much we’ve reduced our uncertainty by picking a split point. By picking the best split each time the greedy decision tree training algorithm tries to form decisions with as few splits as possible.  \n",
    "    - Hyperparameters:   \n",
    "        * Max depth: Limit our tree to a `n` depth to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're creating regression models, we are interested in the ***mean squared error*** and ***R Squared***. The lower our ***R Squared*** the more accurate our model. We intend to use **K-fold cross validation** as well as a **holdout set** as we improve our model through hyperparameter tuning. \n"
